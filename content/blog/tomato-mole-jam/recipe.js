Add the melted butter and spices in the food processor and pulse a few times to just mix. Pour the crumbs into the pan and press into an even layer.  Using the bottom of a glass helps!",
        "Bake the crust for 8-10 minutes, or until golden brown. Once completely cooled, wrap the base of the springform pan in 1-3 layers of tinfoil.  This is so the water from the water-bath doesn’t seep into the cake. ",

Add ricotta and sugar, and beat until smooth. One at a time, add in the eggs until fully incorporated. Add the flour, cornstarch, extracts, salt, lime juice and zest and mix until just combined and a smooth consistency.  Pour batter over the crust and spread evenly.",

Once in the oven, pour boiling water into the pan so that it covers about 1/2 up the side of the pan, 1-1.5 inches high.  Trust me, it’s a lot easier and safer to pour the water in after it’s in the oven than trying to carefully put it on the rack with splashing hot water going everywhere.",
        "Bake for approximately 1.25-1.5 hours. It is done when you can shake the pan and the sides of the cake are set but the center is slightly wiggly, about the size of an inch in diameter. . That’s fine.  Turn off the oven and leave it in the oven for 3 hours with the door closed the entire time.  Take it out and leave it on the counter for another 1-2 hours. Refrigerate (tightly wrapped in plastic wrap) until ready to use, preferably overnight.",

        "When ready to serve, spread the Tomato Mole Jam on top of the cake.  I like to do this while it is still in the springform pan to get nice sharp edges around the side.  Decorate with slivered almonds if desired.  Run a butter knife around the edges of the cake and release it from the pan. Cake can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. "

Combine granulated sugar, water, and rose water in a small saucepan and put over low heat. Attach a candy thermometer to the pan. Stir with a rubber spatula until the sugar is dissolved, about 4 minutes.',\n      '4. Increase to medium high heat and try to stir as little as possible. Brush down the sides of the saucepan if crystals form.  Continuing cooking syrup until the thermometer reads 250°, about 10 minutes.',\n      '5. Once it reaches this temp, immediately remove it from heat and slowly pour the syrup into the tahini mixture, mixing constantly with the spatula.  Continue mixing until the halva is a smooth mass and starts pulling away from the bowl.  Try not to overmix or it’ll become crumbly.  Pour halva into prepared pan and let cool for at least an hour.

Once its boiling, place the bowl on top, making sure it doesn’t touch the water.  Leave for 2-3 minutes to melt and then remove the bowl from heat and stir until glossy and smooth. Let cool a bit.',\n      '3. In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whisk eggs and sugar until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes.  Add in the chocolate mixture till just combined.  Then fold in the flour, cocoa, and salt.  Mash about 1/2 of the raspberries and crumble about 1/3 of the halva and gently stir into the mixture',\n      '4. Pour the brownie mixture into the prepared pan and smooth off the top.  Sprinkle the remaining raspberries and halva cubes on the top, pressing gently so they are somewhat submerged. Drizzle with some tahini if wanted.',\n      '5. Bake for about 20 minutes, until the top is crisp and the middle seems just set. We want them to still be gooey.

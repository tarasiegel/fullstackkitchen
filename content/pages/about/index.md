**hi, Welcome to my little corner of the internet. <br> my name is tara.**

I am currently a resident of Salt Lake City, having moved here for more nature after living in NYC for eight years. Before that, I spent my childhood in South Florida dealing with humidity. I went to college in Philadelphia, where I discovered and honed my love of baking while procrastinating problem sets. Many times I would be making muffins at midnight to break up the _all too frequent_ all-nighters I pulled.

I studied Computer Science/Computer Graphics in school (+ a fine arts minor) and am currently a full time, full stack Senior Software Engineer for a media company. When I was going into an office, bringing sweets to coworkers was key to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. To counteract what didn't make it into the office, I am constantly trying to find ways to be exercising. I am an avid biker, skiing, runner and try to walk everywhere. I've completed 7 half marathons, bike whenever I can, and had an epic 2022-2023 ski season of over 50 days.

If we can get nerdy for a second, I am very proud of this website you see here. The "tech stack", as one would say, is pretty cool. I am using [React](https://reactjs.org/), which is a component based Javascript library for building UI's. That is wrapped in an instance of [GatsbyJs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), which is a React-based, [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) powered, static site generator (makes for better SEO and file hosting!). All the posts are written in [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), which is a lightweight markup language for text syntax. Once I make updates and build it, it gets uploaded and automagically deployed via Netlify!

        "Preheat oven to 375 degrees, spray or butter a 9x13 pan with parchment paper and then butter again to help it not stick.",
        "Combine the oats, flour, brown sugar, coconut, salt and cardamom in a medium sized bowl. Pour the melted butter in with the dry ingredients and combine until completely mixed and a corse texture. Press about 3/4 of the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan.",
        "Add the strawberries, rhubarb, and/or fruit of choice to a large bowl.  Mix in the granulated sugar, cornstarch, bitters, juice cardamom and vanilla. Let it sit for 3-5 min for some for the juices to release.  Pour the fruit mixture into the pan, trying to exclude as much of the liquid as possible.  This will prevent the bars from getting soggy.  Evenly crumble the remaining oat mixture over the fruit.  Place in the over and bake for 35-40 minutes, checking for doneness at around 35 minutes.  The top crumble part should be golden brown and the fruit/juices should be slightly bubbling.",
        "Cool for an hour and then put in the fridge for 2-3 hrs or overnight. Using a wet, sharp knife, cut into squares."

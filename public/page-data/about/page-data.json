Before that, I spent the first eighteen years of my life in South Florida dealing with humidity.  Then I spent four in Philadelphia for college, where I discovered and honed my love of baking while procrastinating problem sets.  Many times I would be making muffins at midnight to break up the <em>all too frequent</em> all-nighters I pulled.</p>\n<p>I studied Computer Science/Computer Graphics in school (+ a fine arts minor) and am currently a full time, full stack Senior Software Engineer for a media company. When I was going into an office, bringing sweets to coworkers was key to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. To counteract what didn’t make it into the office, I am constantly trying to find ways to be exercising.  I am an avid biker, runner and walk everywhere.  Right now I’ve completed 6 half marathons and 2 century rides!</p>\n<p>If we can get nerdy for a second, I am very proud of this website you see here. The “tech stack”, as one would say, is pretty cool.  I am using <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a>, which is a component based Javascript library for building UI’s. That is wrapped in an instance of <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">GatsbyJs</a>, which is a React-based, <a href=\"https://graphql.org/\">GraphQL</a> powered, static site generator (makes for better SEO and file hosting!).  All the posts are written in <a href=\"https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet\">markdown</a>, which is a lightweight markup language for text syntax.  Once I make updates and build it, it hooks into <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> and automatically updates the site!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/about/"},"frontmatter":{"date":null,"title":"About","image":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/9f73aac289633d828e444db0a15f842b/c9771/about-image.jpg"},"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9f73aac289633d828e444db0a15f842b/c6984/about-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9f73aac289633d828e444db0a15f842b/2756e/about-image.jpg 197w,\n/static/9f73aac289633d828e444db0a15f842b/434b5/about-image.jpg 393w,\n/static/9f73aac289633d828e444db0a15f842b/c6984/about-image.jpg 786w,\n/static/9f73aac289633d828e444db0a15f842b/e5b36/about-image.jpg 1572w","sizes":"(min-width: 786px) 786px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/9f73aac289633d828e444db0a15f842b/295b3/about-image.webp 197w,\n/static/9f73aac289633d828e444db0a15f842b/a78ed/about-image.webp 393w,\n/static/9f73aac289633d828e444db0a15f842b/01ffa/about-image.webp 786w,\n/static/9f73aac289633d828e444db0a15f842b/016a7/about-image.webp 1572w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 786px) 786px, 100vw"}]},"width":786,"height":793}}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},

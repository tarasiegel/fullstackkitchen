    instructions: [
      'Preheat oven to 350F degrees. Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers until a fine sand like texture.  Add the sugar, salt and melted butter to the food processor and pulse a few times until combined and a paste has formed. Dump the mixture into a metal pie pan (ceramic is fine, but metal is preferred for the cooling process), and press the mixture into the pan to create an even layer.  Using the back of a measuring cup works really well for this. Bake for 10 minutes in the oven or until it looks slightly golden.  Let cool for at least 10 minutes.',
      'While the crust is cooking, you can start making the ganache.  Combine the chopped dark chocolate and chopped butter in a heat-proof bowl (glass).  Put the heavy cream in a small sauce pan and heat on low until simmering. Pour cream over the chocolate/butter mixture and let stand, covered with a plate or lid for at about 5 minutes.  Then stir until smooth.  It may look separated, but keep on stirring, it will eventually come together. ',
      'Pour the ganache into the slightly cooled crust.  Using an offset spatula or a regular spatula, spread the ganache until itâ€™s nice and even.  Cover the pie pan with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for at least an hour.',
      'Using a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the pudding mix and the milk for 2-3 minutes.  Then with a spatula, gently fold in the cool whip and then the crushed Oreos.  Pour the mixture into the cooled crust + ganache and chill in the refrigerator for another 3-4 hours.'

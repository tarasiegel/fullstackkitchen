Increase the heat to medium and bring the jam to a boil, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon.  Let it cook at a medium boil for 15-20 minutes, stirring every minute or so to prevent the sides and bottom from burning.  At 15 minutes, test the jam.  It should have a thick gelatinous consistency.","Once the jam is done, remove cinnamon sticks and whole star anise.  The jam will be kind of chunky with the dried fruit and nuts.  If you prefer a smoother jam, use an immersion blender stick to puree it a bit.  You can also put it in a food processor or blender.  Afterwards, quickly pour jam into a glass ball jar and seal it.

Let it sit for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours to drain the cheese, since it’s usually pretty watery.","If not using packaged graham cracker crumbs, put the graham crackers in a food processor and pulse until fine.  You can also put the crackers in a ziploc bag and smash them.  Add the melted butter and spices in the food processor and pulse a few times to just mix. Pour the crumbs into the pan and press into an even layer.  Using the bottom of a glass helps!","Bake the crust for 8-10 minutes, or until golden brown. Once completely cooled, wrap the base of the springform pan in 1-3 layers of tinfoil.  This is so the water from the water-bath doesn’t seep into the cake. ","Lower the oven to 325˚F / 160˚C.","Using a electric mixer with a paddle attachment (or by hand if you don’t have a mixer), beat the cream cheese on medium-low until smooth, 1-2 minutes.  Add ricotta and sugar, and beat until smooth. One at a time, add in the eggs until fully incorporated. Add the flour, cornstarch, extracts, salt, lime juice and zest and mix until just combined and a smooth consistency.  Pour batter over the crust and spread evenly.","Place the pan on a roasting pan and put in the oven.  Boil some water.  Once in the oven, pour boiling water into the pan so that it covers about 1/2 up the side of the pan, 1-1.5 inches high.  Trust me, it’s a lot easier and safer to pour the water in after it’s in the oven than trying to carefully put it on the rack with splashing hot water going everywhere.","Bake for approximately 1.25-1.5 hours. It is done when you can shake the pan and the sides of the cake are set but the center is slightly wiggly, about the size of an inch in diameter. . That’s fine.  Turn off the oven and leave it in the oven for 3 hours with the door closed the entire time.  Take it out and leave it on the counter for another 1-2 hours.

I like to do this while it is still in the springform pan to get nice sharp edges around the side.  Decorate with slivered almonds if desired.

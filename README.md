## From Gatsby Boilerplate

### 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd fullstackkitchen/
    npm run develop
    ```

2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `fullstackkitchen` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🚀 Deploy (Netlify)

Before committing to Github, first build the static files via gatsby and commit the files.

```shell
npm run build
```

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── content
    ├── node_modules
    ├── public    
    ├── src
    ├── static
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    └── gatsby-ssr.js

1.  **`/content`**: This directory contains all the markdown files and images used in the blog posts and on the about page 

2.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

3.  **`/public`**: Rendered static files that are automatically generated using `gatsby build`

4.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

5.  **`/static`**: Static files such as favicon and robots.txt

6.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

7.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

8.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

9.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

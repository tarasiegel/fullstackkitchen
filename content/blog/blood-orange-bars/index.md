Its Valentine’s week, which means my feed (and probably yours) is over run with heart shaped this and chocolate that and pink this. Well — this is me adding 1 more in. If you plan on baking this Valentines day, or at least want to bake something cute to bring into the office like what I’m doing, these blood orange bars are great choice! Blood oranges are in season right now and have that beautiful pinkish-red hue that makes my heart flutter. Its essentially a shortbread cookies + a baked curd, so what can go wrong! If you’ve had lemon bars before, its a very similar taste and feel, but slightly less tart!

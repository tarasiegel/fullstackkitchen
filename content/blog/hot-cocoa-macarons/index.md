Hot Cocoa Macarons w/chocolate & marshmallow filling: Its absurdly cold today in NYC (feels like -10ÀöF absurdly cold), which makes me feel way less guilty about spending the majority of today curled up inside, drinking hot cocoa with my best friend Netflix (that Frye Festival documentary was ridiculous). Also eating way too many of these üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è These macarons have spicy chocolate shells (think cocoa, cinnamon, with a hint of cayenne), fluffy marshmallow buttercream, and a creamy dark chocolate ganache center.

    These cookies are a creation of my attempt to use up the multiple jars of dulce de leche my brother graciously brought back for me from his trip to Argentina.  He had some time off while switching jobs.  He is now is at his new fancy hedge fund job and Iâ€™m such a proud older sis! It was also conveniently his birthday, so most of these cookies went to him since he is a CCC fiend.

These cookies have a mix of milk and dark chocolate Gittard discs, flaky salt on top and a healthy dollop of dulce inside, which spreads along with the cookie to create a thin layer of dulce throughout.
